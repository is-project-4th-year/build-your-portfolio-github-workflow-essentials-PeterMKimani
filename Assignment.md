## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

  **Branching**: Helped me separate different features like the navbar and hero section, allowing me to work on them independently without affecting the main project. This kept the development organized and conflict-free.

  **Commit Messages**: I learned how to write clear, meaningful commit messages using conventional formats like feat, fix, and docs. This made it easier to track changes and understand the history of the project.

  **Pull Requests**: I understood how to open pull requests to propose changes, review code, and safely merge feature branches into main. This made collaboration smoother and reduced the chances of bugs slipping through.

  **GitHub Pages Deployment**: I learned how to deploy my portfolio directly from a GitHub branch, which helped me see live updates of my site and share it easily with others for feedback.
